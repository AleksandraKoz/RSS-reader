# Newsly - mobile RSS Reader application

Newsly is a simple and easy to use mobile application built with React Native. It allows you to choose the type of feeds
you want to browse by simply adding the URL you want. You can also filter the content you see and find the article you
want just by typing its title. You can also add the most interesting articles to your 'favourites' list.
